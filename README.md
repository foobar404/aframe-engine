# 🦄 A-Frame Engine
A-Frame Engine is an attempt to modernize and streamline the aframe-inspector/editor to be competitive with modern game engines like Unity, Unreal, or Godot. Complete with an improved 2d editor experience, VR editing mode to be able to edit your world freely completely in VR, better support for the aframe-watcher to sync changes automatically to your codebase, and much more.
